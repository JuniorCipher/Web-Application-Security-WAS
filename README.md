# Phase 1: Web Application Security (WAS)

This repository contains my lab projects from the International Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Academy (ICDFA) under the Web Application Security (WAS) phase.

It includes practical exercises that helped me understand the fundamentals of Linux, Networking, and Bash Scripting - forming the foundation for learning web security concepts. Each task focuses on how systems work behind the scenes, how users and files are managed, and how security can be applied to protect them.

This repository is meant to serve as both a record of my learning progress and a resource for anyone interested in starting their journey in cybersecurity.

### **BVWS101 - Foundation of Linux, Networking & Bash Scripting**

This module provides a foundational understanding of Linux operating systems, computer networking, and Bash scripting. It emphasizes practical system administration skills, including user and group management, file permissions, process control, and automation through shell scripts. The knowledge gained serves as a crucial base for advanced cybersecurity tasks and secure system operations.
